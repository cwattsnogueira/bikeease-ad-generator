##  Overview

BikeEase has successfully implemented AI-powered solutions for demand forecasting, customer review analysis, and image classification. As part of their expansion, this project automates marketing content creation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate persuasive, brand-aligned advertisements.

This capstone delivers a modular, LLM-powered system that generates structured bike rental ads based on user inputs like specifications, discounts, and campaign themes. It integrates Hugging Face models and LangChain for prompt orchestration, and deploys the app with a Gradio front-end on Hugging Face Spaces.
